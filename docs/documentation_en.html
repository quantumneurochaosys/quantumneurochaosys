    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>QuantNeuroChaOSys.js</strong> (Quantum Neuro Chaos System) is a library for modeling multidimensional quantum neural networks. It uses elements of quantum chaos to create nonlinear, high-dimensional models that can learn and adapt to input data. The library offers flexible settings for fine-tuning neuro-quantum nodes and data processing algorithms.</p>
    <p>Neuro-quantum nodes in the context of this library represent elements of a multidimensional neural network that can change their state based on quantum principles. Each node has a state described by multiple parameters (e.g., weights and entanglement levels). Unlike traditional neural networks, where nodes interact with others based on deterministic rules, neuro-quantum nodes use random processes inspired by quantum effects such as superposition and interference.</p>
    <p>The core algorithm of the library involves the creation and interaction of these quantum nodes. Each node has its own state, which can be altered based on its internal weight and environment, as well as random processes. A key feature is the use of quantum entanglement, where the interaction of one node with another occurs not only through direct adjacency but also through more complex interactions with "neighbors" in multidimensional space. This allows the proposed neuro-quantum model of the network to adapt to data with much greater flexibility and power.</p>

        <summary><strong>Model and Algorithm Description</strong></summary>
        <section>
            <h2>Model Description</h2>
            <p>The model used in the <strong>QuantNeuroChaOSys.js</strong> library is based on quantum principles such as superposition, interference, and entanglement to create a neural network. Unlike traditional neural networks, where nodes interact based on predefined weights, this model uses random processes similar to the principles of quantum mechanics to predict the behavior of the network. Below are the main components and algorithms underlying the operation of the library:</p>

            <h3>1. Quantum Node Generation</h3>
            <p>Quantum nodes in this model are created considering their state in multidimensional space. Each node is assigned a state that is a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of dimensions specified by the user. This state is updated using quantum effects like superposition and interference.</p>

            <h4>Formula for updating the node's state:</h4>
            <p>The node's state is updated as follows:</p>
            <pre>
state<sub>new</sub> = Σ (state<sub>neighbor</sub> * weight<sub>neighbor</sub>) + random_factor
            </pre>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>state<sub>new</sub></strong> — new state of the node;</li>
                <li><strong>state<sub>neighbor</sub></strong> — state of the neighboring node;</li>
                <li><strong>weight<sub>neighbor</sub></strong> — interaction weight with this node;</li>
                <li><strong>random_factor</strong> — random component related to quantum effects (e.g., interference).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Quantum Entanglement Principle</h3>
            <p>Entanglement is a phenomenon where the state of one node can be linked to the state of other nodes in the network. In the context of neural networks, this means that the state update of one node will depend on the states of other nodes in the network, even if they are far apart.</p>
            <p>Thus, nodes in this network interact not only with their immediate neighbors but also with more distant nodes, significantly enhancing the network's learning and adaptation. Entanglement also increases the likelihood of complex patterns and non-trivial solutions for complex problems.</p>

            <h3>3. Adaptation through Iterations</h3>
            <p>Each update of a node's state occurs over several iterations. This allows the neural network to gradually adapt to data and improve its results as it processes them. It is important that the number of iterations and their impact on the results can be adjusted.</p>

            <h4>Formula for iterative state update:</h4>
            <pre>
state<sub>new</sub> = state<sub>old</sub> + Σ (weight<sub>neighbor</sub> * state<sub>neighbor</sub>) + random_factor
            </pre>

            <h3>4. Application of Quantum Random Effects</h3>
            <p>The system uses pseudo-random numbers generated through quantum chaos to model random processes that affect the states of nodes. This introduces an element of uncertainty and complexity in data processing, allowing the network to find more intricate and adaptive solutions.</p>

            <h4>Example of generating a random value using quantum principles:</h4>
            <pre>
random_value = sin(Σ (state<sub>node</sub> * weight<sub>node</sub>) % PI)
            </pre>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>state<sub>node</sub></strong> — the current state of the node in multidimensional space.</li>
                <li><strong>weight<sub>node</sub></strong> — the weight associated with this node. It determines the influence of the node on the final value.</li>
                <li><strong>Σ (state<sub>node</sub> * weight<sub>node</sub>)</strong> — the sum of the products of node states and their weights. This expression aggregates information about the current nodes in the network.</li>
                <li><strong>% π</strong> — modulus operation with π. This helps limit values to the range [0, π], simulating quantum effects like phase shift.</li>
                <li><strong>sin(...)</strong> — sine function that converts the result into a periodic value, analogous to quantum wave functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose there are three nodes in the network with states <code>state_1 = 0.5</code>, <code>state_2 = 0.8</code>, <code>state_3 = 0.3</code> and corresponding weights <code>weight_1 = 1.2</code>, <code>weight_2 = 0.7</code>, <code>weight_3 = 0.5</code>. Then:</p>
            <pre>
Σ (state<sub>node</sub> * weight<sub>node</sub>) = (0.5 * 1.2) + (0.8 * 0.7) + (0.3 * 0.5) = 0.6 + 0.56 + 0.15 = 1.31
random_value = sin(1.31 % π) ≈ sin(1.31) ≈ 0.966
            </pre>
            <p>The final value <code>random_value</code> ≈ <code>0.966</code> will be used to update the state of the nodes.</p>

        <h3>Project Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal of the project is to create a library that does not merely model standard neural networks, but offers an alternative approach using elements of quantum chaos. This allows the creation of networks that can tackle more complex tasks, such as predictions under uncertainty, modeling dynamic processes with high levels of chaos and uncertainty, and processing multidimensional data with a unique structure.</p>
    </section>
</section>
    
<section>
    <h3>Project Concept</h3>
    <p>The concept of the project is based on the idea of using quantum principles to extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks. In the traditional approach to neural networks, we are limited by linear mathematics and deterministic algorithms. However, in nature and in the universe, there are often processes that are nonlinear and random. The goal of the project is to create a model that can effectively work with such processes and use them as tools to solve real-world problems.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Philosophy of the Project</h3>
    <p>The philosophy of this project lies in exploring new pathways and methods that open up quantum mechanisms for data processing. This pursuit aims to create flexible, adaptive, and powerful tools for scientific research, artificial intelligence, and solving unconventional problems that cannot be addressed by traditional methods. This research is at the intersection of neuroscience, quantum physics, and chaos theory, offering a completely new perspective on the operation of artificial neural networks.</p>
